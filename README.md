# -Multisensor-systems---Pattern-Classification--KNN-Algorithm-
Monitoring the health condition of the rotating machine via extracting features from sensor data/measurement and applying Principal Component Analysis, PCA. 
Applied K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm for classifying five faults, Fault 1 - Bearing, Fault 2 - Gear Mesh, Fault 3 - Resonance, Fault 4 - Imbalance, Fault 5 - Misalignment. 

In addition to this, deisgned MMSE estimator to predict the actual measured data (without noise) of wind turbine blades and implemented CUSUM two-sided test to identifiy
if the measured data exceeds the desired threshold and generate an alert. 

A report was generated highlighting important findings and critically evaluating the results.
